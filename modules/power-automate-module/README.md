## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **Authentication Flow**
1. Power Platform authenticates with Azure AD
2. Azure AD issues token with configured permissions
3. Custom connector calls your Function App with token
4. Function App validates token and processes request
5. Results returned through Power Platform to consuming app

### **Data Flow**
```
Power App/Flow → Custom Connector → Azure Function → Microsoft Graph → M365 Data
```

### **Permission Model**
Your existing maximum scope permissions (10 permissions) provide full access to:
- **User Management** (User.ReadWrite.All)
- **File Systems** (Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.FullControl.All)
- **Email & Calendar** (Mail.ReadWrite, Calendars.ReadWrite)
- **Teams** (TeamMember.ReadWrite.All)
- **Directory Services** (Directory.ReadWrite.All)
- **Applications** (Application.ReadWrite.All)
- **Exchange** (Exchange.ManageAsApp)

## 📊 Available Operations
